# FluidFluidQueues
For the analysis of stochastic fluid-fluid queues (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2013.12.006).

This package wraps for DiscretisedFluidQueue.jl.

The generator of a discretised fluid queue is an approximation to the generator B in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2013.12.006.

This package uses the discretised generator to approximate operators derived in (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.spa.2013.12.006), such as the first return operator, and limiting distribution. 

More docs to come.
